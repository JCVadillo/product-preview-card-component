This challenge was about creating two designs that replicate the modal given as the example shown for desktop and mobile versions by using HTML and CSS

The creation of helper divs and classes where part of the challenges and were not given

With the help of *Media Queries* and using the property *backg*ound-image* property, this can be done on a single CSS file

**This is pure HTML and CSS**
